# custom-image-classifier-using-tensorflow
This a custom image classifier using tensorflow.js. We will be using a pre-trained model for image classification called MobileNet. We will then train a model on top of this one to customise the image classes it recognises.

check out my live demo here: https://image-classifier-tnsflw.herokuapp.com/
1. Setup basic webapp (Flask) by following this link https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/
2. Set up Webapp structure  by creating /app and /app/templates folder for scalability
3. Linked app folder up to image-classifier-using-tensorflow.py
4. create env variable in .flaskenv for convenience
5. adjusted project structure
